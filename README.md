# Facebook.Music.Player
Was tired of having to manually play and or pause every link that was posted to our facebook music group. Decided to use the Facebook Graph API to steal all the necessary data ( because the facebook sdk is shit ) and design an easy and intuitive way to view all our posts, and listen to all our beautiful music. Collin Burger requests we have a search!
